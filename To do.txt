To do: 
make sure the turn by turn distances change correcty
add re-routing


Try a new stratergy for route defining:
Make every 2 waypoints a separate route mt.Route[n] - I can't see any disadvantage the having several 2 waypoint routes


If a route is modified then either the router makes it's own decisions or anchors are used to constrain the router:
        1 add 2 anchor points to define the bit of the route to be rerouted add option of defining a waypoint as an anchor
        2 add a new waypoint to the route which will remove the section between the anchors.
        3 calculate a new 3 waypoint route between the anchors that includes the new waypoint.
        4 remove the anchor waypoints
        5 repeat process if further modigications are needed

Think about allowing a step back option on editing routes
                   

On next Flutter release see if Impeller is sorted: 
change the android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
remove the lines in  <meta-data
        android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.EnableImpeller"
        android:value="false"

then run flutter clean and rebuild the app.
then run flutter pub get
