Problems with version updates on devices:
Experienced a problem for a little while where after a build
have to do a restart befor the latest build is put on the 
device. Then when running without PC reverts back to previous 
version. The problem started when swapping between debug and
release versions. 
Cure follow 4 steps:
1 flutter clean - removes build and the dependentcies
2 flutter pub get - reinstalls dependentcies
3 remove the version from the device 
4 rebuild on the device

flutter upgrade

Error with wrongParent
The ParentDataWidget Expanded(flex: 1) wants to apply ParentData of type FlexParentData to a RenderObject
This is caused by an Expanded being used for a parent widget other than a Column or Row that it intended for. 
It works in debug mode, but causes a blank screen in r elease mode.

Lesson from this any problems in release mode may well be 
due to problems shown but ignored in debug mode. Sorting all
debug problems is never a bad idea!

Error of unconstrained size:
Failed assertion: line 2251 pos 12: 'hasSize'
This is caused where an expandable widget is the child and grandchild of an expandible widget - Flutter has 
no idea how to lay it out. Must have a constrained container in the tree. 

API tips
ssh root@64.227.34.217
docker exec -it root-db-1 /bin/bash   <-- get inside drives-db-1 container
mariadb -uroot -pmysecret  <-- Start mariadb

To copy a new app version to the Droplet
scp /home/james/Python-3.10.0/Drives/drives/apks/motatek_drives.apk root@64.227.34.217:/root/app/static/apks/motatek_drives.apk

done:
To do sort out problem with group drives 
- Took drive from API 
- Inviter was mobile Stag
- Invitee tablet AC was first to join trip
- Inviter tracked invitee correctly
- Invitee didn't

- Then nulled the lat lng on both group_drive_invitations records and neither tracked
