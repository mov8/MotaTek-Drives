Sorting out images - adding the rotation and caption function
webHelper 1132 handles pointOfInterest images
    originally TripItem just the String imageUrl but now with rotation and captions 
    in images it holds a list of Photo 

TripTile generates the trip info it is called in map_features.dart

Outstanding problems:
Waypoint marker size publishedFeatures
My Trip titles on phone are not spaced properly
Putting drive details in on createTrip doesn't scroll enough on phone
Look at displaying HTML for the helps
The steps actionChip not showing after saveing trip, though it is after loading from mytrips

Stop Following leaves only the Steps ActionChip showing also the Title remains "Following drive .."

Password dialog needs a bit of attention. 
    Once email has been:
        1 validated as a proper address then register button
        2 an existing user login button & password dialog

After deleting all My Drives on going back into My Trip I got a Red Screen.

The tap here to re-route flag doesn't work consistently particularly after a couple of re-routes. It probably needs to identify the next maneuver - so it
never thinks its following the new route. 

There appears to be a bit of an issue with the roundabout descriptions on the Boston to Skegness at the second roundabout it says take exit 3 left when it should say right ?

Thursday 
    Sort out the maneuvers prompts properly - done

Friday
    Sort out picking up new route after re-routing - done
    Look at simplifying the text-to-speech prompts to allow them to be cached as mp3s - done
    Check the tracking option with the simulator - done
    Sort out how the helps will work

Saturday
    Resolve tracking issue - done
    Remove memory cache for offline maps - done

    Think about sound files with the group trip messaging - might be possible to stream audio using socketio
    Implement off-line cache for the sounds in ["half a", "a quarter of"] a mile ["at the roundabout take the {nth} exit", "turn left", "turn right", "fork left", "fork right"] - done

Sunday
    Ensure style can be accessed offline.
    Ensure all the default asset images are loaded OK when offline

Monday
    decide about brochures.
    Start documentation.

CreateTrip.directionTile - Inkwell.onTap() -> widget.onTap() -> createTrip.changeRoute() -> currentTripItem.changeRoutes() ~ 745 does all the calculating

DirectionDescriptos.maneuverIndex is the key parameter that has to be set after re-routing.


my_trip_item.dart  Future<bool> changeRoute() does the re-route 
    it's called from rout create_trip.dart via the directionTileController in directions_tile.dart
